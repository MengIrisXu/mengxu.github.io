# Cambricon: An instruction Set Architecture for Neural Networks
 The Neural Networks (NN) are belonged to a broad range of emerging machine learning and pattern recondition applications. NN are normally executed on general purpose processors which are usually not energy efficient. Because that, recently there are application-specific hardware that are used to improve the energy-efficient. They only designed for a small set of NN techniques sharing similar computational patterns. Although itâ€™s an easy way for limited set of similar NN techniques, the lack of agility in the instruction set make it hard to support a variety of different NN techniques with sufficient flexibility and efficiency. In this paper, the authors propose a novel domain-specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for NN accelerators, called Cambricon. The Cambricon is a load-store architecture which only allows the main memory to be accessed with load/store instructions. Cambricon contains 64 32-bit General-Purpose Registers (GPRs) for scalars, which can be used in register-indirect addressing of the on-chip scratchpad memory, as well as temporally keeping scalar data. Cambricon does not use any vector register file but keeps data in on-chip scratchpad memory. The reason to that is to support intensive, contiguous, variable-length accesses to vector/matrix data. They also do the evaluation over a total of ten representative yet distinct NN techniques have demonstrated that Cambricon exhibits strong descriptive capacity over a broad range of NN techniques. Also compared to the latest NN accelerator design, Cambricon- based accelerator prototype implemented in TSMC 65nm technology incurs only negligible latency, power, and area overheads, with a versatile coverage of 10 different NN benchmarks.
